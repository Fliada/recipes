Чеснок не делить на дольки, разрезать чесночину пополам и положить в кастрюлю. Посолить, перемешать, добавить кориандр, гвоздику, анис. Перемешать, убавить огонь и дать постоять пять минут.\\n\\nВзять двух осьминогов. Осьминоги — самый важный ингредиент. Лучше всего португальские осьминоги. Большие, нежные, не требуют больших затрат. Головы осьминогов отрезать и выбросить. Обычно голову используют, но в этом блюде нужны только длинные щупальца.\\n\\nПрибавить под кастрюлей огонь, положить осьминогов и залить водой, чтобы вода накрыла овощи и осьминогов. Когда варево закипит, снять кастрюлю с огня, положить на смесь бумагу с дыркой посередине — как крышку. Это спасет осьминога от \\xadпере\\xadсыхания. Затем поставить кастрюлю в духовку на полтора часа при температуре 135 градусов. В это время сделать заправку и соус винегрет.\\n\\nДля приготовления заправки можно использовать любое масло, которое не имеет ярко выраженного вкуса. Например, рапсовое или масло из виноградных косточек. Взять четыре желтка, четырех устриц, сок половины \\xadлимона, соль (по вкусу), перец (по вкусу) и чернила каракатицы. Последнее не обязательно: если есть — добавить, если нет — значит, готовить без чернил.\\n\\nВсе эти ингредиенты положить в блендер, взбить до состояния крема. Масло (350 мл) добавить при медленном взбивании смеси. Получилась заправка — устричный майонез. Выглядит он не очень эстетично, но очень вкусен. Живет, правда, недолго. Всего один день.\\n\\nТеперь нужно приготовить цитрусовый винегрет. Для этого половинку луковицы, сельдерей и фенхель нарезать на мелкие кусочки, так лучше ощущается вкус. Раскалить сковороду, налить оливковое масло. Надо припустить овощи в течение одной минуты, чтобы они стали чуть-чуть хрустящими, а не мягкими.\\n\\nДалее добавить две столовые ложки сока устриц, натереть на мелкой терке около 1 г цедры апельсина или грейпфрута, после чего добавить мелко нарезанные перья лука и все тщательно перемешать. Винегрет готов.\\n\\nРазмягчить в воде пластинки желатина. Кастрюлю с осьминогами достать из духовки, вытащить щупальца. Взять 300 мл бульона, в котором были осьминоги, добавить соли, затем желатин, взбить венчиком. Щупальца положить на минуту в бульон с желатином, затем выложить на пищевую пленку, закатать, завязать по бокам на узел с двух сторон, после чего охладить в течение двух часов.\\n\\nРазрезать осьминогов на тонкие дольки, выложить на блюдо, поставить красивые точки устричной заправкой, на дольки налить цитрусовый винегрет и добавить зелень для красоты.\\n\\n',\n 'Промыть утку под проточной водой. Снять кожу и отложить ее, убрать в холодильник. Отделить от тушки крылья и ноги.\\n\\nСрезать с костей грудку. Ее можно добавить в риет, а можно заморозить и использовать для других блюд.\\n\\nРазрезать каркас утки на несколько небольших частей. Срезать с тушки утиный жир, убрать в холодильник.\\n\\nПереложить части утки в миску, посолить, поперчить, перемешать руками. Оставить на ночь в холодильнике.\\n\\nРазрезать 2 луковицы пополам, морковь пополам или на четыре части, если она крупная.\\n\\nПоложить в жаропрочную посуду овощи, чеснок, лавровый лист, специи, утку, все перемешать.\\n\\nДобавить воду и вино.\\n\\nПоставить в разогретую до 160 градусов духовку на 1,5–2 часа. Пару раз за это время открывать духовку и перемешивать содержимое. У готовой утки мясо должно легко отделяться от костей. Но мясо не должно быть сухим, если это так, то его передержали в духовке.\\n\\nВытащить утку из духовки, слегка охладить. Отделить мясо от костей. Отделять, пока все еще теплое: холодную утку сложнее разобрать.\\n\\nПереложить мясо в миску, овощи вместе с выделившимися соками.\\n\\nОбжарить на сливочном масле на сковороде мелконарезанную луковицу до золотистого цвета, добавить ее к утке и овощам.\\n\\nРастопить утиный жир и кожу на сковороде на небольшом огне. Это нужно для того, чтобы жир полностью вытопился и не сгорел. Шкварки убрать (их можно есть просто так).\\n\\nПробить риет в блендере или комбайне на небольшой скорости, чтобы масса стала однородной, но у нее осталась текстура.\\n\\nПереложить риет в формочки или небольшие баночки. Оставить сверху свободной примерно одну пятую формы.\\n\\nЗалить риет сверху утиным жиром.\\n\\nПоставить в холодильник, подождать, пока жир застынет.\\n\\nПодавать с хлебом и ягодным соусом.\\n\\n',\n 'Басмати залить водой на палец, поставить на огонь, довести воду до кипения, добавить щепотку соли, варить 7 минут, после чего добавить кубик сливочного масла, накрыть крышкой, снять с огня и оставить доходить до готовности 12 минут. Готовый рис перемешать и охладить.\\n\\nПараллельно сварить вкрутую яйца. Это 10 минут после закипания воды в кастрюле с яйцами.\\n\\nВзбить венчиком 2 яичных желтка и 1 чайную ложку горчицы, а затем тонкой струйкой вливать в миску растительное масло, не переставая взбивать содержимое миски венчиком до тех пор, пока не случится процесс эмульгации и соус не загустеет.\\n\\nВ готовый майонез добавить щепотку соли, натертый на мелкой терке сыр, каплю вустерского соуса (это, впрочем, факультативно) и несколько капель табаско, срирачи или любого другого острого чили-соуса. Этот соус смешать с рисом.\\n\\nОчистить вареные яйца, отделить белки от желтков. Белки мелко нарубить и смешать с рыбой горячего копчения, разобранной на волокна, и мелко нарубленным зеленым луком.\\n\\nВ подходящую форму выложить на дно половину риса, сверху смесь рыбы, белков и зеленого лука, спрятать все это под следующим слоем риса и обильно присыпать натертым яичным желтком. Запечатать пленкой и поставить на 2 часа в холодильник.\\n\\n',\n 'Настрогать одну молодую неочищенную картофелину жюльеном (тонкой соломкой), смыть лишний крахмал водой, чтобы картофельная соломка при жарке не слипалась, обжарить в большом количестве растительного масла на сковороде (хватит 100 г) или во фритюрнице (не меньше литра) до насыщенного желтого цвета, обсушить на салфетке и посолить.\\n\\nДля соуса нужно карамелизовать на сковороде сахар, добавить к нему мелко нарезанный имбирь и уксусы. Выпарить содержимое сковороды наполовину, затем влить рыбный бульон, сок лайма и варить до густоты.\\n\\nУ свежих вешенок отрезать основание в том месте, где они срастаются, чтобы грибки разделились. Шиитаке обезножить. Листья пак-чой разделить между собой, отрезав корешки, и промыть все по отдельности под струей воды.\\n\\nПриготовить маринад. Для этого нам потребуется смешать сое\\xadвый соус, понзу, мирин, перец и имбирь. Быстро окунуть филе семги в маринад, повалять несколько секунд и отложить обсыхать.\\n\\nПриготовить соус-пюре. Для этого нужно нагреть в кастрюле сливки, сливочное масло и морскую соль. Как только масло растопится, добавить васаби, как следует перемешать венчиком, добавить предварительно отваренную и размельченную оставшуюся картошку и еще раз тщательно перемешать. Снять с огня, взбить силиконовой лопаткой в однородную массу.\\n\\nСемгу обжаривать в течение \\xadнескольких секунд с каждой \\xadстороны на хорошо разогретой сково\\xadроде, налив немного маринада, чтобы соевый соус, в котором мариновалась рыба, немного подрумянил ей бока, затем отправить филе на пять-семь минут в духовку.\\n\\nОбжарить грибы на сковороде, чуть сбрызнутой растительным маслом: сначала шиитаке, затем к ним добавить вешенки, листья пак-чой, а последними грибы иноки. Затем добавить немного маринада от рыбы и тушить еще десять секунд. В общей сложности обжаривать грибы около двух минут. Важно не переборщить с маринадом, чтобы грибы не оказались слишком солеными.\\n\\nВыложить пюре на тарелку, сверху уложить рыбу, рядом — грибы и листья. Подавать, посыпав содержимое тарелки картофельной стружкой и полив соусом. При желании соус можно подать отдельно.\\n\\n',\n 'Сливочное масло заранее достать из холодильника, чтобы оно размягчилось.\\n\\nЧернослив вымыть. Если он слишком сухой, промочить в дуршлаге горячей водой и обсушить. Несколько штук отложить для украшения. Выложить чернослив в миску, залить коньяком и оставить на 30 минут.\\n\\nВ глубокой сковороде растопить 1 столовую ложку сливочного масла.\\n\\nКогда оно только начнет пузыриться, выложить печень, увеличить огонь и жарить 5 минут, чтобы печень осталась розоватой внутри.\\n\\nПереложить печень вместе с маслом и мясными соками из сковороды в тарелку.\\n\\nЛук очистить и тонко нарезать.\\n\\nДобавить на сковороду еще 1 столовую ложку сливочного масла, растопить и выложить лук. Уменьшить огонь до минимума, выложить лук и томить его до прозрачности, не давая зажариться и потемнеть.\\n\\nВыложить в блендер печень вместе с маслом и соками, добавить лук и чернослив с коньяком. Туда же выложить все оставшееся сливочное масло и протереть все в гладкую массу.\\n\\nЕсли паштет получился слишком густым, добавить немного куриного бульона. Перемешать, посолить и поперчить.\\n\\nРастопить смалец или топленое масло и залить паштет в формы.\\n\\nУкрасить каждую форму черносливом. Убрать в холодильник минимум на 4 часа.\\n\\nПодавать с любимым хлебом.\\n\\n']"
