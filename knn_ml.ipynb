Замороженного осьминога нужно просто разморозить, удалить клюв, вскрыть голову и удалить все внутренности, все хорошо промыть. Можно обойтись без заморозки, но тогда нужно свежего осьминога хорошенько отбить: можно сделать это молотком или бить его прямо об стол, от этого мясо станет мягче. Вскипятить воду в большой кастрюле, добавить соль и опустить осьминога в кипящую воду на минуту, затем достать его из кастрюли на минуту, повторить эту процедуру 3–4 раза. Это тоже поможет стать мясу мягче, а щупальца свернутся. Вернуть осьминога в кастрюлю и варить 30–40 минут, в зависимости от его размера. В конце выключить огонь и оставить осьминога в воде еще на 5–10 минут.\\n\\nПараллельно сварить очищенный картофель целиком в подсоленной воде.

Маргарин растопить на медленном огне, перемешать с мукой и соединить с яично-сахарной массой.\\n\\nПеченую тыкву натереть на терке и добавить в тесто. Перемешать до однородности.\\n\\nПолученное сметанообразное тесто выложить небольшими порциями на смазанный жиром противень и выпекать 10-12 минут в предварительно нагретой до 150°С духовке.\\n\\n',\n 'Если у вас нет молотого миндаля – не беда!. Вечером возьмем обычный необжареный миндаль,  Забланшируем его в кипятке несколько минут, охладим и очистим от шкурки. Бланшированная шкурка снимает как чулок, очень легко. Очищенный миндаль оставим подсыхать на ночь – я положила в сито и на батарею. Миндаль смолоть вместе с сахаром – необходимо делать именно так, т.к. при размоле миндаля выделяется масло, масса моментально склеивается и заставляет кофемолку буксовать. Сахар впитывает масло в себя.\\r\\nВ миске смешать сухие ингредиенты, потом добавить белок (взбивать не надо). Получается миндальное тесто – марципан. Завернуть его в пленку и положить на час в холодильник. \\r\\n Подготовить глазурь. Взбить белки с щепоткой соли, постепенно добавляя пудру. У вас должна получиться глазурь подобная куличной – густая, с кремовой структурой.

Скатать в шар, завернуть в пленку и положить в холодильник минимум на 30 мин. Разъемную форму диаметром 26 см смазать маслом и посыпать мукой.Распределить тесто руками в форме ровным тонким слоем, сделав бортики.Приготовить начинку. В блендере взбить творог, сметану, сахар, желтки 2 яиц, крахмал.Отдельно взбить в крепкую пену 2 белка и аккуратно смешать их с начинкой.Сливы помыть, сделать надрезы, но не до конца, вынуть косточки. В надрезы насыпать по пол чайной ложки смеси сахара с корицей.Уложить сливы в форму с тестом разрезом кверху.Аккуратно ложкой выложить на сливы начинку. Поставить пирог в разогретую духовку и выпекать около часа при температуре 180-200 градусов. Температура и время выпечки зависит от вашей духовки.

Залить все 1 литром воды, поставить на средний огонь и довести до кипения. Убавить огонь до тихого и варить бульон 20 минут.\\n\\nВыложить в него филе трески и варить еще 7 минут.\\n\\nПереложить филе на тарелку, убрать из кастрюли рыбные кости и овощи, бульон процедить.\\n\\nУ ботвы оборвать стебли. Листики ботвы и щавель положить в сотейник (стараясь не смешивать их между собой или связав в отдельные пучки) и залить горячей водой.\\n\\nЧерез 30 секунд достать листья щавеля и переложить в миску с холодной водой, еще через 1 минуту вынуть листья ботвы и переложить туда же.\\n\\nОгурцы и редис вымыть. Огурцы нарезать мелкими ломтиками, редис — колечками.\\n\\nКвас перелить в форму для льда и заморозить. Получившийся лед измельчить в блендере.\\n\\nОтваренное филе рыбы разрезать вдоль пополам, затем — на кусочки в 2–3 см.

В самом конце можно посолить, если соль не является преступлением на вашей кухне.\\n\\nГотовому бульону дать слегка остыть, чтобы оставшийся жир начал застывать пленкой на поверхности, снять его, а потом тщательно процедить бульон через мелкое сито или даже сито с марлей. Собственно, в этот момент как раз и обретается искомая диетичность этого блюда, которое советские диетологи в небольших количествах раз\\xadрешали.\\n\\nС телячьих голяшек обобрать мясо, нарубить его или разобрать вручную на волокна, смешать с рубленым укропом и петрушкой и залить, выложив в форму, бульоном. В принципе, коллагена из двух голяшек вполне должно хватить на нормальную текстуру холодца, но если вы волнуетесь, можно добавить несколько пластинок желатина, предварительно замочив их в холодной воде, а потом, отжав от воды, вбив венчиком в бульон.\\n\\nОставить холодец застывать на ночь. Тем временем приготовить сальсу, для чего нарезать мелкими кубиками мякоть помидоров, смешать ее с нарубленной петрушкой, красным луком и тертым хреном — чайную ложку на полкило помидоров. Заправить маслом и лимонным соком. Также к холодцу можно нарезать немного редиски с укропом.\\n\\n',\n 'Минтай хорошо промыть, срезать плавники, очистить внутренние пленки.Острым ножом отделить филе.

Можно также потереть маргарин на терке и потом смешать руками с мукой — главное, действовать быстро, чтобы маргарин не начал таять.\\n\\nВ смеси муки и маргарина сделать небольшую ямку. В стакане смешать одно яйцо с уксусом и солью. Долить стакан доверху водой.

В остывшую массу добавить размягченное сливочное масло и цедру и хорошенько взбить.\\n\\nКаждую часть охлажденного теста по очереди раскатать в тонкий пласт, выложить на противень, проткнуть ножом в нескольких местах и выпекать при 180 градусах в течение пятнадцати минут. Из обрезков теста слепить отдельный комок, тоже раскатать и выпечь последним. Этот коржик пойдет на обсыпку.\\n\\nГотовые коржи остудить и выложить на разделочную доску. Острым ножом аккуратно обрезать края, чтобы придать им ровную прямоугольную форму, — для этого их можно сложить стопочкой.\\n\\nПервый корж намазать кремом, накрыть другим коржом и осторожно придавить руками. Снова смазать кремом, накрыть следующим коржом и придавить. Должно получиться три яруса.\\n\\nПоследний ярус намазать кремом и, поломав руками последний коржик, густо посыпать сверху получившейся крошкой. Обрезать еще раз неровные края и отправить торт в холодильник минимум на пару часов, а лучше — на ночь.\\n\\n',\n '1.Тыкву порезать пластинками толщиной не более 0,5 см, ветчину, колбасу (если есть, у меня фигурирует подкопченная говяжья в равных пропорциях с ветчиной; вполне можно обойтись одной ветчиной) и одну часть сыра порезать как можно тоньше, другую измельчить на терке. Лучше если ветчина и сыр будут тоньше тыквы, так как они обладают ярко выраженным вкусом при равных или больших пропорция, они будут сводить к минимуму нежный аромат тыквы. 2.Готовим заливку: смешиваем молоко (можно заменить бульоном, например, грибным), яйцо, муку.
